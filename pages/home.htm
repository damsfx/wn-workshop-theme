        <p>Welcome to the Winter CMS Workshop. This theme provides a suitable boilerplate for testing the most common
        Winter CMS plugins with a simple but visually pleasing theme. It is built using the
        <a href="https://tailwindcss.com" target="tailwind">Tailwind CSS</a> framework, also providing a suitable
        example of how to implement Tailwind CSS in a theme.</p>

        <p class="mt-4">In this instance, the theme is testing out a simple CMS page with a partial underneath the main content.</p>
